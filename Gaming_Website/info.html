      <h2>
       History of the Game
      </h2>
      <p>
     It's interesting to think about this game's history. In the days of old, Final Fantasy when the developers
     were making the first game in the franchise they had never actually intended this to be a series.
     Sakaguchi called it Final Fantasy as he thought it would be the last game he ever really made. The devs of Square
     had made a lot of games but just were not very successful as a company. Then when the first game in the franchise
     was released it was a sprawling massive success and completely revitalized them. To think the franchise is pretty much
     up to number 16 at this point in time is insane to reflect upon how many have been made. Although they're not really
     directly connected as the games are very much standalone with each entry. Square did a major 
     change up coming off the last batch of final 
     fantasy games before entry 9. Number 9 was a return to roots for them after veering off into a more cyberpunk science fiction
     blended direction with Final Fantasy 7. They went back to traditional fantasy, which makes it one of the most stand out 
     and more memorable games in the franchise. 
      </p>
      <h2>
       The General Game Play 
      </h2>
       <p>
       Generally speaking it follows the traditional style of turn based rpgs where you 
       take turns in combat and it is similar to what the franchise has used in previous iterations. 
      Combat is determined with the ATB gauge, short for the Active Time Battle system. Each character
      must wait till the gauge is full before taking their turn and then they can proceed to do an 
      action, whether it's using an item, attacking or defending. Characters with a higher speed stat will have
      a faster filling gauge so it will be their turn sooner. 
      </p>
<p>
      You may have 4 characters in combat at a time. On the world
      map you walk around in, depending on how an encounter is approached will affect the flow of battle with an 
      enemy you see there. You can either ambush the enemy from the back when you walk into them
       which will give you an advantage in battle with your gauges being full from the start or 
       if the enemy manages to pre-emptively ambush you that means you're in trouble with them getting 
       the opportunity to strike first. Being ambushed will also mess up your party formation and your rows will be reversed. Row formations whether a party member
      is placed at a back or front row can determine how much damage they do with their regular physical
      attacks. There are two modes of attack usually with magic or physical. Being placed at the back
      row will reduce the amount of damage a party member will take however it will also reduce any physical
      damage they do from there. The characters will have a variety of skills and abilities which range can be
      passive to buff your own party's stats or actively attacking the enemy and a wide range of 
      status effects can be afflicted to hinder someone. When a party member gets
      K'O'ed and their HP drops to zero, they can still be revived through an ability a character has or items.
      You may also flee and run away from a battle, although that may not always be 100% successful and you can't 
      flee from boss encounters. 
       </p>
       <p>
      Trance is another game mechanic where you can deal massive damage 
      to the enemy or buffs with a character that can dole out a special move when in this temporary state.
      It's determined by a Trance gauge where it will slowly fill up as the characters are getting damaged.
      You gain experience towards leveling up to improve your stats and money after each and every battle. 
      There is a handy menu screen where you can also view your stats, experience points, items, money and abilities.
      You can also swap out party members from there as well. Certain equipment when you use it repeatedly can also
      grant abilities and level them up. Outside of combat you'll be visiting various
      objective locations to progress the story and there is a ton of exploration to do on the world map with
      the towns and dungeons around. Tons of NPC characters to talk to and going around to stores to better
      equip your characters with items and equipment to purchase. There is a crafting system as well where you can 
      make better items by synthesizing the required materials you pick up along the way. There's various
      side quests to do and other extra challenges for the player.

       <h2>
       Tips and Strategies
       </h2>
       <ol>
        <li> Don't bother planning around the Trance state, it's completely erratic when it happens
          and often a wasted opportunity when it's far too late already as the battle has progressed.
        </li>
        <li>Use the back and front row formations wisely, put your hard hitting physical party members at the front
          and the more ranged members that rely on spells and long distance attacking at the back row to be the most
          effective in battle. 
        </li>
        <li>The tent can be a weirdly useful item in battle, you can actually use it on an enemy instead
          of your own party members. Whilst it can fully restore your HP it also has a 50% chance 
          to inflict many status effects, like poison, blind and silence. This can be good to inflict
          on a particularly tough boss and make it that much easier. Because the early game can be quite brutal.
        </li>
        <li>It can be pretty useful to hang onto old gear you have as tempting as it may be to just
          sell each and everything. You can use it for later to synthesize even better items
          through smithing/crafting. So that's always important to keep in mind.
        </li>
        <li>The main character Zidane has a handy steal ability and you should always commit to using that
          as much as you possibly can with bosses. They can hold onto some amazing high level equipment to use and 
          it's free at that, so it will cost you nothing. 
        </li>
        <li> Battling Grand Dragons in Popos Heights can grant you tons and tons of experience to level your 
          characters insanely fast. It's best to kill off all the other characters and keep one alive for 
          maximum experience gain.
        </li>
        <li>Beware of Yans, they make look harmless and cute on appearance but they will absolutely murder 
          your entire party quickly with the multiple ferocious attacks they do if you aren't prepared and taken
          by surprise. They are by far the most difficult normal enemies in the game. 
        </li>
        <li> Save often, you never know when you could get into a particularly bad situation where your entire party
          gets K.O.ed unexpectedly and get a game over. It would be terrible if you hadn't saved for hours
          only to lose all that progress.
        </li><li>Keep track of enemy elemental weaknesses and strengths in a battle, using certain spells against their weakness 
        will grant you good bonus damage. Fire is effective against undead enemies and ice enemies, water is effective
        against fire enemies etc. 
        </li>
       </ol>
