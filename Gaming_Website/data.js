    reviewText: `This was a fantastic game from beginning to end. The best FF game I've ever played. The characters were amazing and
    the story couldn't have been more engrossing. I couldn't put the game down as soon as I started it. For anyone who's a 
    fan of traditional jrpgs, this gets a whole hearted endorsement from me. You won't regret your purchase of this!`

    reviewText: `A very well made title, whilst the gameplay itself is not groundbreaking for it's genre
    it more than makes up that for in spades with the charm and heart put into making it stand out. You'll laugh
    and cry during the story, emotional as much as it is fun. It surprisingly hits on much darker themes really than you could imagine 
    despite the cartoony appearance of it's art style. You'll feel pretty satisfied by the pay-off at the end and there
    is a lot of depth to be found in this.

    reviewText: `Absolute masterpiece is all I can say, everyone should go out 
    and play this game right at this moment. What are you wasting your time here for? It's been awhile
    since I played a jrpg this entertaining. The Final Fantasy franchise went downhill badly with FF 7, a title
    so this is a welcome return to form and a big sigh of relief. A lot of the humor is pretty funny and
    the grand master Nobuo Uematsu as composer delivers another stunning soundtrack that adds so much atmosphere
    to the game.

    reviewText: `A very enjoyable time, sometimes you want to just sit back and enjoy a slower paced rpg.
    Just leisurely grinding your way through and leveling up, that's quite a relaxing experience in my book.
    Vivi is also my boy, and the best character out of the cast in this game. There's no denying black mages
    are the coolest in this entire franchise. How can one not love him? I want to cuddle him fairly hard.`

    reviewText: `The absolute worst thing I've ever played in my life and laid my eyes upon. Why would people waste their time with this?
    Turn based style combat is terribly outdated, it's all about real time these days and quick reflexes. 
    I can't deal with a grinding slow pace such as that. Also more realism in graphics is much better to me, I hate the way
    this game looks. The plot feels quite contrived and the characters are nothing to write home about, being too simple for my taste.
    Best to play Call of Duty over this. Real gamers play FPS games. `
