      <h2>About me and the reason for picking this game:</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Gordon Tan and I'm a college student at Seneca taking Computer Programming
        and Analysis. I've really loved playing video games my entire life since I was a young kid
        and to to be honest, was a big inspiration for me to get into programming in the first
        place. I always wondered to myself how do games even operate and work? I started messing
        around in some basic Flash around Grade 10 and loved it ever since then. Game development on
        the side has also just been a personal hobby of mine and I really enjoy doing a lot of
        research into that. I've actually dabbled with game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine.
        Took some time to delve into openGL to understand how the graphics pipeline works and
        shaders have always been really cool to me. I love looking at video games from an analytical
        perspective as much as I enjoy playing them and breaking down how they did things. Final
        Fantasy 9 is probably out of the entire final fantasy franchise the one I held closest to my
        heart. Out of at least the 3D final fantasy games, it was always the most interesting one.
        I'm more of a fan of traditional high fantasy stuff more than anything else in this
        franchise and the character designs are just so distinct and memorable with it's cartoonier
        look. My preference has always leaned to more cartoon aesthetics than realistic graphics as
        that just ages better over time to me. Hence why I was pretty firm on picking this
        particular game. It's one of those important games that really shaped my taste.
